# Kux-Krux

Kux implementation using local setups.

this doesn't use Kux's libraries, only Krux.

## Setup

To setup, cd into lib/Krux.

Type 'make' and copy the lib/krux.so | krux.dll into include.

This allows lua to use it.

Create a new folder in your /usr/local directory called "include54" and copy the contents of your include to that folder.


## Description

This program attempts to imitate Kux's programs using Krux, a more polished version of the Kux libraries.

This makes the logic seem much simpler, while lowering the bloat code from Kux.
